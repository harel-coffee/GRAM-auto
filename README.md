# GRAM

Source code for GRAM.
Along with Knowledge Tracing and News Recommendation codebase, we provide a simple MNIST example to play around with GRAM. 

Below `gram` folder, you can find respective models for knowledge tracing and news recommendation in `knowledge_tracing` and `news_recommendation` repo. 
To run models, use `run_script.py` for knowledge tracing and `run_pl_nrms.py` for news recommendation. Before running the script, we reommend installing the gram package with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e gram
```
